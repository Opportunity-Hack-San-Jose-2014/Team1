    <dc:description>View of the &quot;Sentinel Tree&quot; and one of the earliest San Jose hotels beside it, as they both appeared in 1904. At that time, the sycamore was thought to be about 400 years old. It was a landmark to settlers in the 1840s, an indication that they had arrived in San Jose. Formerly twice as tall as it appears in this photograph, the top half cracked off in a storm in the 1890s. It was finally taken down in March 2000, because the owners feared it would fall onto to their 1950s era house. It stood at 590 North 21st Street.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Group of fourteen Japanese orchard workers sit, gathered around a large pile of Tussock moth cocoons. The cocoons had to be removed from the trees by hand in the days before pesticides. A bonfire would then be set on the pile. A man and a woman in dress clothes are standing above the seated workers. The man is writing in a small notebook, perhaps tallying up the number of cocoons picked by each worker.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Photograph of a railroad derailment that took place in Santa Clara on August 28, 1899. Two engines derailed here, although one is under No. 1377 and cannot be seen. These two trains in tandem were pulling a heavy load of passengers returning from Monterey. They derailed at this intersection of broad and narrow gauge railroad tracks when a switchman switched the track to narrow gauge without realizing a broad gauge train was fast approaching. There were a few minor injuries but no one was seriously hurt. A large crowd is milling around examining the wreck. Note that many of the men have their train tickets tucked into their hatbands. In the background is the Santa Clara Depot as well as two trains unable to proceed.</dc:description>

The fourth story was built of wood. The smaller two story &quot;annex&quot; in front was used for storage. When this photograph was taken the mill had been abandoned for a number of years. The main structure was demolished in 1915. The &quot;annex'&quot; survived and after restoration became the home of the History Museum of Los Gatos.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Black-and-white photograph of the Kensington Post Office, Willow Glen. Between Jan. 14, 1893 and Jan. 14, 1895, all mail addressed to residents of Kensington, California, went to the Kensington Post Office, housed in this grocery store on the northeast corner of Minnesota and Cherry avenues in what is now San Jose. This post office bore the name Kensington until it became Willowglen in 1895. It continued as Willowglen until the transferring of its mail service to San Jose on Jan. 15, 1900. It continued to house a store until razed to make way for Station 6 of the San Jose Fire Department, built in 1963. The bearded man in the photo is probably Postmaster Albert E. Winlow who, with D. W. Smythe, operated the grocery store under the name of A. E. Winlow &amp; Co.&quot; Grocery items can be seen stacked on the porch and in the windows.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Engraving of the Knox Building, also called the Knox Block. The Knox Building stood at the northwest corner of First Street and Santa Clara Street. It was constructed in 1866, and demolished in 1945. Businesses housed in the Knox Building included: a real estate office, a musical instruments shop, the Feist Brothers' dry goods store and two cigar shops.  A doctor, a contractor, lawyers and architect Levi Goodrich had offices on the second floor. Note the San Jose Library on the second floor at far right. Horse drawn trolleys pass through a busy intersection. This engraving is from Thompson &amp; West's 1876 Historical Atlas of Santa Clara County.</dc:description>

It meant spraying, dusting, pruning, irrigating, or some other form of attention almost the year around. Deer sometimes proved pests to orchardists in the foothill areas, but brown rot, shot hole borer, leaf curl, San Jose scale and oak root fungus evoked a lot more profanity. This photo shows a spray crew at work in an orchard, a common sight in the valley every year just before the trees came into bloom and foliage.&quot;</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The Peralta Adobe is the oldest surviving structure in San Jose and its only surviving adobe. It was restored in 1976 as part of the Bicentennial celebration. In this 1947 photograph it is unrestored with a tin roof and serving as a storehouse for plumbing supplies. The Peralta Adobe is a San Jose Historic Landmark, a California Historical Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The adobe was most likely built by Manuel Gonzalez, a member of the Anza Party and a founder of the Pueblo de San Jose de Guadalupe. Luis Maria Peralta came to San Jose in 1807 when he was named comisionado of the Pueblo.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Women walk toward City Hall. This was San Jose's Old City Hall before demolition. It stood in Plaza Park, now known as Plaza de César Chávez, where the children's fountain is located. The building housed city offices and the police department used the basement. In use since 1889, the building was demolished in June 1958. Statue in foreground is of Dr. Henry D. Cogswell, a prohibitionist. It stood atop the drinking fountain he donated to the city.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Photograph of an advertisement for the Sunset &quot;Thirty&quot; automobile manufactured by Victory Motor Car Company in San Jose.  By 1909 the Victory Motor Company was advertising that the new Sunset models were &quot;guaranteed to make a mile a minute.&quot;  The factory was turning out eight new cars a month and more than 230 Sunsets were registered in San Jose alone.  But the Sunset never reached a market beyond the San Francisco Bay Area.  By 1917 there were only 37 Sunsets registered in California.  Today, only one surviving Sunset automobile is known to exist.</dc:description>
