    <dc:description>This float, based on the book &quot;Whither Mankind,&quot; by historian Charles Austin Beard, symbolized international peace as realized through education. The float featured &quot;a battleship of peace&quot; with a mass of flowers, organ pipes used for a smoke stack, an airplane at the prow, depicting the future, and a group of children from various schools representing the nations of the world. The boat was built of white sweet peas, delphinium, and wild flowers. Crowds of people are watching them. There are houses and cars in the background.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>It is unknown if this car was entered by an organization. The car is sparsely decorated with a banner of what appears to be bells with bows at the top. There are two children standing on the outside of the car hanging off the sides. The driver is not visible. Three women and one man are sitting in the vehicle. The woman nearest the front is holding a flowered tamborine. All the people are dressed in Californio/Mexican costumes. A United States flag hangs over the grill of the car. There are crowds of people in the background.</dc:description>
